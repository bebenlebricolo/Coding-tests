Here you will find my current and past work about testing "new" ideas (when I say new, I'm talking about my new ideas, however they surely exist somewhere else, on other projects, etc.)
It's more for me a way to capitalize on ideas, share them with people and use them as milestones for my current projects.

I try to publish those files without any bugs and with comments / documentation.
However, they may not be perfect, have remaining bugs, unclear comments and documentation. 
I will be more than happy if the reader contacts me and tells me where I should rework things.

Finally, I'm doing this with the "Open Source" spirit (at least, I try my best for it!), this is why you can find those tests around here.

Note : some of my tests may have been written to target embedded device, such as 8-bit microcontrollers. 
Some of their dedicated compilers (like avr-gcc) cannot handle the entirety of C++ language (templates, dynamic allocation, console prints, vectors, etc, are not allowed).
This implies that I must reduce the code size as much as possible and use some "tricks" to get around those limitations. 
This explains why, when <vector.h> is needed, I have to work my way around it and find another way (closer to C implementation) to get passed this issue.

Happy coding!
