# GoogleCloudAuthentication
This is a small side project for trying out different ways to achieve service account and end user authentication flows using python code.
The need arose in order to try out the Google Cloud Run apis and services, after I created a project on Google Cloud Platform, service accounts and setup a sample "Hello" container for testing purposes.

I needed to mimick an end user login to a client application, which in turn will trigger the run of an engine located in the Cloud Run platform.

# Config files setup
In order to properly work, this project needs various config files under the [Config](Config) folder :
* client_secrets.json -> Contains the client secrets (client needs to be of type Web Client and need to have a redirect uri attached for this procedure to work)
* service.json -> Contains the secrets and details generated by GCP while registering a new service account
* test_service.json -> Cloud Run service endpoint name, in a small json file (for ease of parsing ...)
* firebase.json -> Firebase client configuration, retrieved when connecting Firebase service with your project under GCP

Template files were abstracted into the [ConfigTemplates](ConfigTemplates) folder, so that you can compare the formats later on.

# Requirements
You need to have a **recent Python3 installed** for this to work (***Python >= 3.10***, because I'm using type hints in the codebase for better readability)
This little project needs several tools in order to properly work, you can install the required dependencies using `pip` :
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or alternatively
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
